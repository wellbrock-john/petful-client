# Petful Client

## Petful is a demo application to showcase full stack skills I have acquired through Thinkful's Engineering Immersion program. It allows a user to enter a waiting queue by simply providing their name. For demo purposes, the queue does not change unless a user has entered a name. When that happens, the person who is up next in the queue will 'adopt' a pet. That's it! Simple and straightforward.

- - Your name will appear in the queue and the automated adoption will begin and continue until it is your turn to adopt. Then you will have the option to choose between one of the two pets on the screen.
